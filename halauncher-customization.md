HALauncher Customization
========================

HALauncher seems to be pretty configurable in terms of launcher item targets.
But if you want a launcher item per game, it requires a painful amount of touching around.

The only way to load pre-configured menus is to backup your current menus, then offload the `Backup_HAL` directory, modify the XML content, push it back the device, and restore from that configuration.

But for now that's what we'll try to do.
