Thoughtbucket repo for customizing the experience with my GPD XD Android portable.

*I bought this device to make it easier to travel with and play games I own.*
*I can only suggest you do the same.*
*Support game developers.*

It might eventually contain some scripts to ease configuration but for now it's just my notes.
