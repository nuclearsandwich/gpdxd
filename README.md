Thoughtbucket repo for customizing the experience with my GPD XD Android portable.

*I bought this device to make it easier to travel with and play games I own.*
*I can only suggest you do the same.*
*Support game developers.*


### Infrastructure

- **App Store** Aptoide
- **Launcher** HALauncher
- **Android** Stock GPD Firmware 4.4.4
- **Web Browser** Firefox for Android


It might eventually contain some scripts to ease configuration but for now it's just my notes.
